                            The film was jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Universal Pictures. 
                            It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, and Ralf Möller.
                            Crowe portrays Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. 
                            Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of 
                            the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.

                        <p>Inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel "Those About to Die", the film's script, initially written by  
                            Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. The film is loosely based on real events that occurred within the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 2nd century AD.
                            As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. 
                            Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. 
                            Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were "too unbelievable" to include.

                            A gladiator was an armed combatant 
                            who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent 
                            confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. 
                            Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal 
                            and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, 
                            schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even 
                            in death.
                            Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of 
                            Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire 
                            admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, 
                            and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace
                            objects throughout the Roman world. </p>

                        <p>The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. 
                            There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of 
                            the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential 
                            feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. 
                            Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.
                             The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, 
                             reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd 
                             century AD. The games finally declined during the early 5th 
                             century after the adoption of Christianity as state church of 
                             the Roman Empire in 380.</p>

                <p>A match was won by the gladiator who overcame his opponent,

                     and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned

            directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co-produced by units in Malta, 
            Mexico and Britain's Shepperton Studios.The film features an ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom.
            It is loosely based on Homer's Iliad in its narration of the entire story of 
            the decade-long Trojan War condensed into little more than a couple of weeks, 
            rather than just the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon in the ninth year. </p>

                     defeats Thessaly's champion in single combat, 
                     forcing Triopas and Thessaly to join Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms. 
                     Achilles leads his Myrmidons along with the rest of the Greek army invading the 
                     historical city of Troy, defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film 
                     (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the Iliad, but rather from Homer's Odyssey 
                     as the Iliad concludes with Hector's death and funeral.</p></div>

                <span class="text-danger" style="font-size: 2rem">Kingdom of Heaven</span> is a 2005 epic 
                historical drama film directed and 
                produced by Ridley Scott and written by William Monahan.
                The story is set during the Crusades of the 12th century. A French village 
                blacksmith goes to the aid of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in its defence against the 
                Ayyubid Muslim Sultan, Saladin, who is fighting to claim the city from the Christians; 
                this leads to the Battle of Hattin. The film script is a heavily fictionalised portrayal 
                of the life of Balian of Ibelin.Filming took place in Ouarzazate, Morocco,
                 where Scott had previously filmed Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, and in Spain, 
                 at the Loarre Castle (Huesca), Segovia, Ávila, Palma del Río, and Seville's Casa de 
                 Pilatos and Alcázar. The film received mixed reviews upon theatrical release.

                <div class="mt-3"><p>Bloom's character, Balian of Ibelin, was a close ally of Raymond III of Tripoli, the film's Tiberias, 
                    and a member of that faction which sought a place within the patchwork of the Near East and opposed the aggressive policy of 
                    Raynald of Châtillon, the Templars, and "fanatics newly from Europe", who refused to come to terms of peace with the Muslims. 
                    Balian was a mature gentleman, just a year or two younger than Raymond, and one of the most important nobles in the kingdom, 
                    not a French blacksmith. His father, Barisan (the French "Balian"), founded the Ibelin family in the east, and probably came 
                    from Italy. Balian and Sibylla were indeed united in the defence of Jerusalem but no romantic relationship existed between the two. 
                    Balian married Sibylla's stepmother Maria Comnena, Dowager Queen of Jerusalem and Lady of Nablus. Nablus, rather than Ibelin, 
                    was Balian's fief at the time of Jerusalem's fall.</p></div>

                                <div class="card-text">After a brief reconnoiter around the city, Saladin's army came to a rest before the 
                                    Tower of David and the Damascus Gate. His archers continually pelted the ramparts with arrows. Siege 
                                    towers/belfries were rolled up to the walls, but were pushed back each time. For six days, 
                                    skirmishes were fought with little result. Saladin's forces suffered heavy casualties after each assault.
                                    <br> On September 26, Saladin moved his camp to a different part of the city, on the Mount of Olives where 
                                    there was no major gate from which the crusaders could counter-attack.
                                    The walls were constantly pounded by the siege engines, catapults, mangonels, petraries, Greek fire, 
                                    crossbows, and arrows. A portion of the wall was mined, and it collapsed on September 29. The crusaders 
                                    were unable to push Saladin's troops back from the breach, but at the same time the Muslims could not gain 
                                    entrance to the city. <br> Soon there were only a few dozen knights and a handful of remaining men-at-arms defending the wall, as no more men could be found even for the promise of an enormous fee.
                                    At the end of September, Balian rode out with an envoy to meet with the sultan, offering surrender. 
                                    Saladin told Balian that he had sworn to take the city by force, and would only accept an unconditional 
                                    surrender. After some negotiations the two men came to an agreement and the defenders were allowed to 
                                    leave unharmed.</div>
